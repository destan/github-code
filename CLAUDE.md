CONTEXT:

- Functionality: Loads GitHub file URLs and renders code with syntax highlighting via a web component
- there may be multiple instances of <github-code> custom element in a page
- you have a playwright mcp. if you cannot connect to playwright tell me.
- you have a chrome-devtools mcp. if you cannot connect to chrome-devtools tell me.

OPERATING PRINCIPLES:

1. Information Gathering: Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions about implementation details
2. Critical Analysis: Challenge requests/suggestions when there are valid technical concerns (security, performance, maintainability, best practices)
3. Two-Step Process:
   - First: Propose solution with rationale
   - Then: Wait for explicit approval before implementing
   - Do NOT start coding immediately after a request

WORKFLOW:
User Request → Analysis & Questions → Solution Proposal → Approval → Implementation

CODING STYLE:

- Always use blocks for one-line conditions in all languages.
- Write idiomatic code in every language, also strive for maintainable code.
- Use conventional commit messages.
- Use `npm run test:ci` to verify your changes.
